<h1 class="warn">No XML node description available! Please add.</h1>
<h2>How to adapt your NodeDescription</h2>
    <p>
    Create an XML file, which is named exactly like your NodeFactory and placed 
    in the same directory. The NodeDescription explains the 
    functionality of the node, the configuration options, the node's view and 
    the meaning of the in- and outports.</p>
    <p>The format of the node description must comply with an XML Schema. The current schema can be retrieved from
    <a href="http://knime.org/node/v2.12.xsd">http://knime.org/node/v2.12.xsd</a>. Briefly, the NodeDescription XML is
    structured in the following way:
	</p>
	<dl>
	<dt>knimeNode: </dt>
	<dd>The knimeNode must have the correct namespace, e.g. <em>http://knime.org/node/v2.12</em>, i.e. is must begin with
	<pre>&lt;knimeNode xmlns="http://knime.org/node/v2.12" 
	   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	   xsi:schemaLocation="http://knime.org/node/v2.12 http://knime.org/node/v2.12.xsd"&gt;</pre>
	Additionally add an icon and define the type as attributes:
	<code>&lt;knimeNode icon="./yourIcon" type="Visualizer" /&gt;</code>
	The icon should be contained in the same directory as the XML file and the 
	NodeFactory.
	</dd>
	<dt>name: </dt>
	<dd>The name of your node
	</dd>
	<dt>shortDescription:</dt>
	<dd>the short description says in one sentence what your node does.
	This will be displayed, if you click on the category, your node is contained in or
	multiple nodes are selected.
	</dd>
	<dt>fullDescription: </dt>
	<dd>The full description should explain the functionality 
	of your node and help a user to use it. It will be displayed, if only your
	node is selected. 
	</dd>-
	<dt>option: </dt>
	<dd>for each control element in your dialog describe the meaning of it here. 
	The option name is the label of it used in the dialog. 
	</dd>
	<dt>ports:</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul>
		<li>inPort: the inports with the index - a name displayed 
		in the tooltip and a description, which is displayed in the NodeDescription,</li>
		<li>outPort: the outports with the index, a name displayed 
		in the tooltip and in the context menu and a description, which is displayed in the NodeDescription,</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>views: </dt>
	<dd>explains what is displayed in the view with an index of the view (since a node may have several views), 
	a name displayed in the context menu and a description for the NodeDescription. 
	</dd>
